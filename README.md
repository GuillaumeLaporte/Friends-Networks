The (Main.py) file contains the code that gives the results for the first
analysis described in the report. The file contains comments that explain
many parts of the code, what it does at each steps.

The (Unfreezing More Layers.py) file contains the code the gives the results for
the second analysis described in the report. This file contains less comments,
because it consists of small modifications of the code given in (Main.py).
It is not beautiful code, neither done in the most efficient way, because we were 
in a hurry.

you probably shouldn't look at it..

(modelPrinting.py) is some code to visualize the models architectures.
